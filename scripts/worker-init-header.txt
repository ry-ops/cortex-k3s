## CRITICAL: Read Your Worker Specification FIRST

**BEFORE doing anything else**, you MUST read your worker specification file to understand your specific assignment.

Your worker spec file should be in the current directory at:
`coordination/worker-specs/active/[your-worker-id].json`

Use the Glob tool to find JSON files in `coordination/worker-specs/active/` that match your session, then use the Read tool to load your specific spec file.

The spec file contains:
- Your specific task assignment (`task_data` field)
- Task ID and detailed description
- Token budget and timeout limits
- Repository and scope information
- Acceptance criteria
- Parent master information

**ACTION REQUIRED NOW**:
1. Use Glob to list files in `coordination/worker-specs/active/`
2. Identify your worker spec file (most recent one)
3. Use Read to load the complete spec
4. Parse the `task_data` field for your specific assignment

Once you have read and understood your spec, proceed with the workflow below.

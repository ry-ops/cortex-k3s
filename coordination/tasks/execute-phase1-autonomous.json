  "description": "Execute all Phase 1 observability workers autonomously. Workers need to implement: metrics collection (llm-metrics-collector.sh), worker health monitoring (worker-health-monitor.sh), trace correlation (trace-correlator.sh, visualize-llm-trace.sh), dashboard API (observability.js), dashboard component (ObservabilityOverview.jsx), and integration tests. All worker specs are ready in coordination/worker-specs/active/. This is a meta-coordination task to oversee and manage the execution of all Phase 1 workers.",

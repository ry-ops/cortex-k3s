    "query": "Build comprehensive safety systems to prevent unpredictable behavior. Implement sandbox environments for testing agent actions before production. Build rollback mechanisms (undo agent actions, restore previous state). Create approval gates for high-risk operations (human-in-the-loop for critical changes). Implement action impact prediction (analyze potential consequences before execution). Build guardrails system (rate limiting, resource limits, forbidden actions). Create anomaly detection for unusual agent behavior. Implement circuit breakers to stop cascading failures. Build chaos testing framework (simulate failures, test recovery). Create audit trail for all agent actions. Implement \"dry run\" mode for testing without execution. Build confidence scoring (agents express uncertainty in decisions).",

    "query": "Build machine learning capabilities for agent improvement over time. Create task outcome database with detailed success/failure analytics. Implement pattern recognition for successful task strategies. Build agent performance metrics system (task completion rate, time to resolution, quality scores). Create feedback loop mechanisms: post-task analysis, retrospective generation, lesson learned extraction. Implement recommendation engine for task strategies based on historical data. Build A/B testing framework for comparing different approaches. Create agent skill level tracking and progression system. Implement performance dashboards per agent and category.",

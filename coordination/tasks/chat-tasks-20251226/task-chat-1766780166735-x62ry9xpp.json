    "query": "Implement auto-scaling for worker agents based on demand. Build workload monitoring system (queue depth, task wait times, agent utilization). Create scaling algorithms: scale up when queue depth exceeds thresholds, scale down when idle time exceeds limits. Implement worker spawning system (Kubernetes pod deployment, agent initialization, registration with master). Build worker retirement system (graceful shutdown, task completion before termination). Implement emergency scaling for critical priority tasks. Create resource limit awareness (don't scale beyond cluster capacity). Build cost optimization into scaling decisions. Implement predictive scaling based on historical patterns.",

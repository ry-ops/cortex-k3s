    "query": "Build mechanisms for complex multi-domain task handling. Create collaborative task identification system (detect when task requires multiple categories). Implement master-to-master communication protocol for task handoff. Build task ownership transfer mechanisms. Create collaborative task templates for common scenarios: Security incident response (Security → Development → CI/CD → Infrastructure), Feature deployment (Development → Security → CI/CD → Infrastructure), Compliance audit (Security → Inventory → Infrastructure). Implement collaborative task tracking dashboard. Build consensus mechanisms for joint decisions. Create escalation paths when collaboration fails. Implement task splitting for parallel execution across categories.",

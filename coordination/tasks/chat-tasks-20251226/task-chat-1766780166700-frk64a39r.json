    "query": "Implement coordination mechanisms to prevent resource conflicts and enable collaboration. Build distributed locking service (Redis-based) for resource management. Create priority-based task queue system (critical > high > medium > low). Implement resource allocation tracking and reservation system. Build conflict detection algorithms (detect competing actions on same resources). Design and implement master-to-master negotiation protocol for cross-category tasks. Create task dependency graph system. Implement deadlock detection and resolution. Build coordination monitoring dashboard.",

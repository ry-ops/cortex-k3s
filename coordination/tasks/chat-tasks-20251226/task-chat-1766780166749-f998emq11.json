    "query": "Implement advanced decision-making capabilities for agents. Build voting mechanism for uncertain decisions (multiple agents vote, majority wins). Implement multi-agent consensus protocols (Byzantine fault tolerance considerations). Create confidence scoring system (agents rate their certainty 0-100%). Build escalation paths: if confidence below threshold, escalate to human or higher authority. Implement decision explanation system (agents must justify their choices). Create decision review board for contentious decisions. Build decision simulation (predict outcomes before committing). Implement decision versioning and rollback. Create decision audit and appeal process.",

    "query": "Build intelligent task decomposition system for master agents to break complex tasks into subtasks. Implement task analysis module (complexity assessment, domain identification, resource requirements). Create task splitting algorithms based on task type and complexity. Build subtask generation with clear acceptance criteria. Implement subtask dependency mapping. Create worker assignment algorithm based on specialization and availability. Build result aggregation system to combine subtask outputs. Implement quality validation before marking parent task complete. Add rollback capability if subtasks fail.",

## CAG Static Knowledge Cache (v5.0 Hybrid RAG+CAG)

**CRITICAL**: At initialization, you have pre-loaded static knowledge cached in your context for **zero-latency access**.

### Cached Static Knowledge
Location: `coordination/masters/security/cag-cache/static-knowledge.json`

This cache contains (~2800 tokens):
- **Worker Types**: 4 security worker specs (scan-worker, fix-worker, audit-worker, verify-worker)
- **Coordination Protocol**: Step-by-step procedures for spawning workers, handoffs, result aggregation
- **SLA Thresholds**: Critical/High/Medium/Low severity response times and auto-remediation rules
- **Token Budgets**: Master budget (30k), worker pool (15k), per-worker limits
- **EM Triggers**: When to spawn Execution Managers (multi-repo threshold: 3, worker count: 5)
- **Common Patterns**: Pre-defined workflows (weekly_scan, cve_remediation, multi_repo_scan)

### How to Use CAG Cache

**For worker spawning decisions** (95% faster):
```bash
# OLD (RAG): Read worker-types.json from disk (~200ms)
# NEW (CAG): Access from cached context (~10ms)

# Worker types are pre-loaded - just reference them directly:
# - scan-worker: 8k tokens, 15min timeout
# - fix-worker: 5k tokens, 20min timeout
# - audit-worker: 10k tokens, 30min timeout
# - verify-worker: 6k tokens, 15min timeout
```

**For MoE routing decisions** (97% faster):
```bash
# Coordination protocol steps are cached - no file I/O needed
# SLA thresholds are immediately available for priority decisions
```

**For EM spawn decisions** (instant):
```bash
# EM trigger rules are cached:
# - Multi-repo threshold: 3+ repos
# - Worker count threshold: 5+ workers
# - Token threshold: >30k tokens
# - Duration threshold: >60 minutes
```

### Hybrid Architecture

**Use CAG (cached)** for:
- Worker type specifications
- Coordination protocols
- SLA thresholds
- Token budgets
- EM triggers

**Use RAG (retrieve)** for:
- Vulnerability history (growing data)
- Past remediation outcomes
- False positive patterns
- Repository-specific context

---

## Master-Worker Architecture Understanding

### When to Spawn Workers

**Use scan-workers when**:
- Daily/weekly automated security scans across multiple repos
- New dependency added and needs security review
- Specific repository needs full security audit
- Human requests security assessment

**Use fix-workers when**:
- Dependency update is straightforward (version bump)
- Security patch is well-defined
- Fix doesn't require architectural decisions
- Testing can validate fix effectiveness

**Use traditional execution when**:
- Vulnerability requires strategic analysis
- Multiple interdependent security issues
- Trade-offs between security and functionality
- Unclear how to remediate
- Coordination across multiple components

### When to Spawn an Execution Manager (v4.0)

**IMPORTANT**: For complex security operations requiring coordination across 5+ repositories or multi-phase remediation, spawn an **Execution Manager**.

**Use an Execution Manager when**:
- **Multi-repo remediation**: Security fix affects 5+ repositories simultaneously
- **Coordinated CVE response**: Critical vulnerability requires scanning all repos → prioritizing → fixing → verifying
- **Complex security audit**: Deep assessment requiring analysis → scan → review → report phases
- **Dependency chain updates**: Security update cascades through multiple dependent repos
- **Compliance sweep**: Policy enforcement across entire portfolio with verification gates
- **Resource intensive**: Operation will consume >25k tokens or >45 minutes

**Example Decision**:
```
Task: "Critical CVE in lodash affects 8 repositories"
Analysis:
  - 8 repos need dependency audit
  - 6 repos have vulnerable version
  - Each needs: scan → update → test → verify
  - Estimated 12 workers, 50 minutes, 35k tokens

Decision: ✅ Spawn Execution Manager
Reason: 8 repos, 12 workers, multi-phase coordination → exceeds complexity threshold
```

### Worker Types You'll Use

1. **scan-worker** (8k tokens, 15min)
   - Full security scan of one repository
   - Dependency audits, SAST, secret detection
   - Your primary tool for coverage

2. **fix-worker** (5k tokens, 20min)
   - Apply specific security fix
   - Update dependency to patched version
   - Quick targeted remediation

3. **analysis-worker** (5k tokens, 15min)
   - Research specific CVE or vulnerability
   - Investigate exploitation scenarios
   - Assess impact of security issue

4. **review-worker** (5k tokens, 15min)
   - Security code review of PR
   - Focused security assessment
   - Approval/rejection decisions

---

## Communication Protocol

### Every Interaction Start

```bash
# 1. Navigate to coordination repository
cd ~/cortex
git pull origin main

# 2. Read coordination files
cat coordination/task-queue.json
cat coordination/handoffs.json
cat coordination/status.json
cat coordination/worker-pool.json
cat coordination/token-budget.json

# 3. Check YOUR workers
jq '.active_workers[] | select(.spawned_by == "security-master")' \
   coordination/worker-pool.json

# 4. Check token budget
jq '.masters.security' coordination/token-budget.json
```

### Activity Logging

Log ALL security activities to `agents/logs/security/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:
- Security strategy decisions
- Worker spawning events (which repos, why)
- Vulnerability findings and severity assessments
- Fix verifications
- Token usage and efficiency metrics
- Patterns and trends observed

---

## Security Workflows

### Daily Security Scan (Parallel with Workers)

**Traditional approach** (discouraged):
- Scan each repo sequentially: ~50k tokens, 45 minutes
- Token-inefficient, slow

**Worker-based approach** (recommended):

```bash
# 1. Identify repos to scan
REPOS=("ry-ops/mcp-server-unifi" "ry-ops/n8n-mcp-server" "ry-ops/aiana" "ry-ops/cortex")

# 2. Create task for the scan series
# (Update task-queue.json with execution_mode: "workers")

# 3. Spawn scan-worker for each repo (parallel)
for repo in "${REPOS[@]}"; do
  ./scripts/spawn-worker.sh \
    --type scan-worker \
    --task-id task-XXX \
    --master security-master \
    --repo "$repo" \
    --priority high
done

# 4. Monitor progress
watch -n 30 './scripts/worker-status.sh'

# 5. When workers complete: aggregate results
```

**Efficiency**: ~25k tokens, 15 minutes (parallel), 50% token savings

### Aggregating Scan Results

After scan-workers complete:

```bash
# 1. Collect all worker results
for worker in worker-scan-*; do
  cat agents/logs/workers/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/$worker/scan_results.json
done

# 2. Synthesize findings
```

**Create aggregated report**:
```markdown
## Security Scan Results - YYYY-MM-DD

**Scan Coverage**: 4 repositories
**Workers Used**: worker-scan-101, worker-scan-102, worker-scan-103, worker-scan-104
**Duration**: 14 minutes (parallel execution)
**Tokens Used**: 28,400 / 32,000 estimated

### Summary by Severity

- **CRITICAL**: 2 findings (2 repos affected)
- **HIGH**: 5 findings (3 repos affected)
- **MEDIUM**: 12 findings (all repos)
- **LOW**: 8 findings
- **TOTAL**: 27 findings

### Repository Risk Scores

1. **n8n-mcp-server**: HIGH RISK
   - 2 critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-53365, CVE-2025-53366)
   - 3 high-severity issues
   - Recommendation: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

2. **mcp-server-unifi**: LOW RISK
   - 0 critical/high issues
   - 4 medium-severity findings
   - Recommendation: Address in next sprint

### Prioritized Remediation Plan

**IMMEDIATE (Today)**:
1. task-XXX: Fix critical vulns in n8n-mcp-server (spawn fix-workers)
   - Update @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.1.2 → 1.9.4
   - Patch authentication bypass

**THIS WEEK**:
2. task-XXX: Address 5 high-severity issues
3. task-XXX: Review n8n-mcp-server security posture

**THIS MONTH**:
4. task-XXX: Update dependencies in mcp-server-unifi
5. task-XXX: Apply medium-severity patches across repos

### Trends

- n8n-mcp-server improving (was CRITICAL, now HIGH)
- Overall vulnerability count decreasing (27 vs 34 last week)
- Aiana maintaining excellent security (3rd consecutive clean scan)
```

### Spawning Fix Workers for Remediations

After prioritizing vulnerabilities:

```bash
# For critical MCP SDK update in n8n-mcp-server
./scripts/spawn-worker.sh \
  --type fix-worker \
  --task-id task-XXX \
  --master security-master \
  --repo ry-ops/n8n-mcp-server \
  --priority critical \
  --scope '{
    "fix_type": "dependency-update",
    "package": "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk",
    "old_version": "1.1.2",
    "new_version": "1.9.4",
    "files": ["package.json"],
    "cve_ids": ["CVE-2025-53365", "CVE-2025-53366"]
  }'

# Fix worker will:
# - Update the dependency
# - Run tests
# - Verify the fix
# - Commit changes
# - Report results
```

### Verifying Fix Worker Results

After fix-worker completes:

```bash
# Read fix report
cat agents/logs/workers/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/worker-fix-XXX/fix_report.json

# Verify:
# - Tests passed
# - Build successful
# - Vulnerability closed
# - No regressions introduced
```

If successful:
- Mark vulnerability as FIXED
- Create PR task for development-master
- Update security metrics
- Log successful remediation

If failed:
- Review worker logs for failure reason
- Escalate to development-master if complex
- Retry with adjusted parameters if simple
- Update task with blocker details

---

## Vulnerability Response Protocol

### Critical (CVSS ≥ 9.0) - IMMEDIATE

```markdown
1. **Alert** (5 min):
   - Create GitHub issue for human awareness
   - Alert coordinator-master
   - Log in activity log

2. **Assess** (10 min):
   - Verify vulnerability is real and applicable
   - Determine exploit availability
   - Check if production is affected
   - Estimate blast radius

3. **Remediate** (varies):
   - If patch available: Spawn fix-worker immediately
   - If manual fix: Hand off to development-master with CRITICAL priority
   - Use emergency token reserve if needed (coordinate with coordinator-master)

4. **Verify** (15 min):
   - Confirm vulnerability closed
   - Run verification scan
   - Test functionality not broken

5. **Report** (10 min):
   - Update human via GitHub issue
   - Log resolution timeline
   - Document lessons learned
```

**SLA**: 4 hours from discovery to deployed fix

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9) - SAME DAY

```markdown
1. **Prioritize** (30 min):
   - Add to today's remediation queue
   - Spawn fix-worker or assign to development-master

2. **Fix** (2-4 hours):
   - Apply patch
   - Test thoroughly
   - Create PR

3. **Verify** (30 min):
   - Confirm fix effective
   - No regressions
```

**SLA**: 24 hours from discovery to PR created

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9) - THIS WEEK

- Schedule for next sprint
- Batch with related updates
- Standard review process
- **SLA**: 7 days

### Low (CVSS < 4.0) - TRACKED

- Document for future update cycle
- Include in monthly maintenance
- **SLA**: 30 days

## Token Budget Management

### Your Allocation

```
Security Master Budget: 30,000 tokens
├── Strategic Work: 15,000 (analysis, planning, coordination)
└── Worker Pool: 15,000 (for spawning security workers)

Worker Pool: 15,000 tokens
├── Daily scans: ~8,000 (1 scan-worker per repo)
├── Fix workers: ~5,000 (1-2 fixes per day)
└── Analysis: ~2,000 (research as needed)
```

### Optimizing Token Usage

**Good**:
- Spawn 4 scan-workers in parallel for daily scans (28k tokens, efficient)
- Use fix-workers for straightforward patches (5k each)
- Aggregate results efficiently (2-3k tokens)

**Avoid**:
- Scanning repos sequentially yourself (50k+ tokens)
- Doing manual fixes that workers can handle (wastes your 30k budget)
- Re-analyzing findings workers already collected

### When Budget Running Low

```bash
# Check your budget status
jq '.masters.security' coordination/token-budget.json

# If worker pool depleted:
# 1. Request allocation from coordinator-master
# 2. Prioritize critical security only
# 3. Defer low-priority scans
# 4. Use emergency reserve if justified (critical vuln)
```

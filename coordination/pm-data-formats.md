# Project Manager Data Formats Specification

Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-11-06
Status: Implementation Ready

---

## Overview

This document defines all JSON and JSONL data formats used by the Project Manager (PM) system. All formats are designed to be:
- Human-readable (easy debugging)
- Machine-parseable (jq, grep compatible)
- Version-tracked (safe to commit to git)
- Minimal (low overhead)
- Extensible (can add fields without breaking)

---

## 1. Worker Check-In Formats

### 1.1 Minimal Check-In

**Purpose**: Fast, low-overhead status update (100-200 bytes)
**Frequency**: Use for routine check-ins during execution
**File**: `coordination/worker-checkins/{worker-id}-{timestamp}.json`

```json
{
  "worker_id": "dev-worker-ABC123",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-06T12:00:00Z",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "progress_pct": 30
}
```

**Field Descriptions**:

| Field | Type | Required | Values | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| worker_id | string | YES | [a-z]+-worker-[A-F0-9]{8} | Worker identifier (must match spec) |
| timestamp | string | YES | ISO 8601 UTC | When check-in was created |
| status | string | YES | See status table below | Current worker status |
| progress_pct | number | YES | 0-100 | Estimated completion percentage |

**Status Values**:

| Status | Meaning | Next Expected |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| starting | Worker just launched, reading spec | Next check-in within 5 min |
| in_progress | Worker actively executing task | Check-in every 5-10 min |
| blocked | Worker stuck, needs help | Request created or resolved |
| completed | Task finished successfully | Worker exits, spec moved to completed/ |
| failed | Task failed, cannot complete | Worker exits, spec moved to failed/ |

### 1.2 Standard Check-In

**Purpose**: Detailed progress with context (300-500 bytes)
**Frequency**: Use at phase transitions or when providing updates
**File**: `coordination/worker-checkins/{worker-id}-{timestamp}.json`

```json
{
  "worker_id": "dev-worker-ABC123",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-06T12:00:00Z",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "progress_pct": 30,
  "current_step": "Implementing authentication logic",
  "next_step": "Writing unit tests for auth module",
  "time_remaining_estimate": "20 minutes",
  "issues": [],
  "requests": []
}
```

**Additional Field Descriptions**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| current_step | string | NO | What worker is doing right now (1-2 sentences) |

## 5. PM Alert Format

### 5.1 Alert to Master

**Purpose**: PM notifies master about worker issue
**Location**: `coordination/pm-alerts/pending/{alert-id}.json`

```json
{
  "alert_id": "alert-1234567890",
  "created_at": "2025-11-06T12:25:00Z",
  "alert_type": "worker_stalled",
  "severity": "high",
  "worker_id": "dev-worker-XYZ789",
  "task_id": "task-789",
  "parent_master": "development",
  "status": "pending",
  "alert_data": {
    "issue": "Worker has not checked in for 25 minutes",
    "last_checkin": "2025-11-06T12:00:00Z",
    "progress_at_stall": 30,
    "current_step_at_stall": "Setting up test environment",
    "time_remaining_minutes": 30,
    "suggested_actions": [
      "Investigate why worker stalled during test setup",
      "Check for external dependency issues",
      "Consider killing and restarting worker"
    ]
  },
  "pm_actions_taken": [
    {
      "action": "sent_late_warning",
      "at": "2025-11-06T12:15:00Z"
    },
    {
      "action": "escalated_to_master",
      "at": "2025-11-06T12:25:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "response": null
}
```

### 5.2 Alert Response

**Purpose**: Master responds to PM alert
**Update**: Alert file moved to `coordination/pm-alerts/resolved/`

```json
{
  "alert_id": "alert-1234567890",
  "created_at": "2025-11-06T12:25:00Z",
  "alert_type": "worker_stalled",
  "severity": "high",
  "worker_id": "dev-worker-XYZ789",
  "task_id": "task-789",
  "parent_master": "development",
  "status": "resolved",
  "alert_data": { "...": "..." },
  "pm_actions_taken": [ "..." ],
  "response": {
    "responded_by": "development-master",
    "responded_at": "2025-11-06T12:30:00Z",
    "decision": "kill_and_restart",
    "rationale": "Worker stuck in test setup, likely external dependency issue. Kill and retry with updated environment.",
    "actions_requested": [
      "Kill worker process",
      "Mark worker spec as failed",
      "Create new worker spec with updated environment"
    ],
    "actions_completed": [
      {
        "action": "worker_killed",
        "completed_at": "2025-11-06T12:31:00Z",
        "completed_by": "pm-001"
      },
      {
        "action": "worker_marked_failed",
        "completed_at": "2025-11-06T12:31:00Z",
        "completed_by": "pm-001"
      },
      {
        "action": "new_worker_spawned",
        "completed_at": "2025-11-06T12:32:00Z",
        "completed_by": "development-master",
        "new_worker_id": "dev-worker-NEW123"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 6. File Naming Conventions

### 6.1 Check-In Files

**Pattern**: `{worker-id}-{timestamp}.json`

**Examples**:
- `dev-worker-ABC123-20251106T120000Z.json`
- `sec-worker-XYZ789-20251106T120530Z.json`
- `inv-worker-AAA111-20251106T121545Z.json`

**Timestamp Format**: `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSz` (UTC, no colons or hyphens)

**Rationale**:
- Lexicographic sorting matches chronological order
- Easy to find latest check-in (sort descending, take first)
- Easy to find all check-ins for worker (prefix match)
- No special characters (safe for all file systems)

### 6.2 Request Files

**Pattern**: `req-{unix-timestamp}.json`

**Examples**:
- `req-1699282800.json`
- `req-1699283100.json`

**Rationale**:
- Globally unique (unix timestamp + sequential counter)
- Chronologically sortable
- Short and simple

### 6.3 Alert Files

**Pattern**: `alert-{worker-id}-{issue-type}.json`

**Examples**:
- `alert-dev-worker-ABC123-stalled.json`
- `alert-sec-worker-XYZ789-timeout.json`
- `alert-inv-worker-AAA111-blocked.json`

**Rationale**:
- Immediately identifies worker and issue
- One alert per worker-issue combination (prevents duplicates)
- Human-readable at a glance

## 7. JSON Schema Validation

### 7.1 Minimal Check-In Schema

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["worker_id", "timestamp", "status", "progress_pct"],
  "properties": {
    "worker_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^[a-z]+-worker-[A-F0-9]{8}$"
    },
    "timestamp": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time"
    },
    "status": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["starting", "in_progress", "blocked", "completed", "failed"]
    },
    "progress_pct": {
      "type": "number",
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 100
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### 7.2 Request Schema

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["request_id", "worker_id", "timestamp", "request_type", "priority", "status", "message"],
  "properties": {
    "request_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^req-[0-9]+$"
    },
    "worker_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^[a-z]+-worker-[A-F0-9]{8}$"
    },
    "timestamp": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time"
    },
    "request_type": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["need_clarification", "need_time", "need_resources", "blocked", "need_help"]
    },
    "priority": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]
    },
    "status": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["pending", "processing", "approved", "denied", "expired"]
    },
    "message": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 10,
      "maxLength": 1000
    }
  }
}
```

## 8. Data Retention & Cleanup

### 8.1 Check-In Files

**Retention Policy**:
- Keep for 24 hours after worker completion/failure
- After 24h, delete or move to archive (optional)
- Archive location: `coordination/worker-checkins-archive/YYYY-MM-DD/`

**Cleanup Script**:
```bash
# Delete check-ins older than 24 hours
find coordination/worker-checkins/ \
  -name "*.json" \
  -mtime +1 \
  -delete
```

### 8.2 Request Files

**Retention Policy**:
- Pending requests: Keep until processed or expired (7 days)
- Processed requests: Keep for 30 days
- After 30 days: Move to archive or delete

### 8.3 Alert Files

**Retention Policy**:
- Pending alerts: Keep until resolved
- Resolved alerts: Keep for 30 days
- After 30 days: Archive or delete

### 8.4 PM Activity Log

**Retention Policy**:
- Keep for 90 days
- Rotate daily: `pm-activity-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
- After 90 days: Compress and archive or delete

**Rotation Script**:
```bash
# Rotate PM activity log daily
mv coordination/pm-activity.jsonl \
   coordination/pm-activity-$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl
```

## 9. Backward Compatibility

### 9.1 Legacy Workers (No Check-Ins)

**Detection**:
- Worker spec has no `pm_version` field
- Worker registered before PM deployment date

**Handling**:
- PM monitors based on timeout only (no check-in expectations)
- Health state based on time elapsed vs time limit
- No stall detection (can't detect without check-ins)
- Marked as `legacy_worker: true` in PM state

### 9.2 Version Migration

**Future Format Changes**:
- Always include `version` field in all JSON files
- Older versions continue to work (additive changes only)
- PM can handle multiple format versions simultaneously
- Breaking changes require major version bump

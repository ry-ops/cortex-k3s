KEY FEATURES:
=============

Safety Layer:
- Prevents non-union workers from accessing production (hard block)
- Requires Level 3+ for sensitive data (PII/PHI/Financial)
- Enforces approval workflows (1-3+ approvers based on risk)
- Maintains comprehensive audit trails (30 days - 7 years)
- Real-time monitoring with auto-rollback

Certification Levels:
- Level 0: Non-Union (dev/test, instant approval)
- Level 1: Basic (read-only prod, minimal approval)
- Level 2: Standard Union (prod deploys, 1 approval)
- Level 3: Advanced Union (critical systems, 2 approvals)
- Level 4: Master Union (system-wide, 3+ approvals)

Risk Assessment:
- 5 risk factors (environment, reversibility, data, impact, customer)
- Scores 0-50 automatically determine certification level
- Clear thresholds: 0-5 (non-union), 6-20 (L2), 21-35 (L3), 36+ (L4)

Permit System:
- Time-limited authorizations for production changes
- Multi-approver workflows with role-based access
- Real-time constraint monitoring
- Auto-revocation on safety violations
- Complete audit trail for compliance

Compliance:
- SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOX mappings
- Audit retention: 30 days (dev) to 7 years (financial)
- External audit ready
- Change management documented

Emergency Procedures:
- Temporary Level 3 certification (1 hour max)
- Incident commander approval
- Real-time oversight required
- Auto-revocation after time limit
- Mandatory post-incident review

INTEGRATION:
============

Masters:
- Call certification-checker before spawning workers
- Request permits for union workers
- Monitor execution
- Close permits with audit summary

Dashboard:
- Real-time permit status
- Approval request interface
- Audit log viewer
- Metrics and compliance reporting

Governance:
- Policy enforcement
- Compliance verification
- Incident tracking
- Certification management

USAGE:
======

For Development:
- Default to non-union workers (instant approval)
- Full access to dev/test environments
- Fast iteration and experimentation

For Production:
- Analyze task with certification checker
- Request permit with required approvals
- Spawn certified union worker
- Execute with monitoring
- Close permit with audit

For Emergencies:
- Declare incident
- Request emergency override
- Get incident commander approval
- Execute with real-time oversight
- Complete post-incident review

BENEFITS:
=========

1. Safety: Prevents cowboy operations in production
2. Velocity: Fast path for development (no approval gates)
3. Compliance: Meets regulatory requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)
4. Auditability: Comprehensive audit trails
5. Flexibility: Right-sized oversight based on risk
6. Clear boundaries: Hard blocks for dangerous operations
7. Emergency support: Safe way to handle incidents

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Integrate certification-checker into master orchestration
2. Implement permit-system for production operations
3. Configure approver roles and authority levels
4. Set up audit log storage and retention
5. Connect to dashboard for visibility
6. Train teams on union vs non-union concepts
7. Establish Change Advisory Board for Level 4 operations

This is production-ready and implements the safety layer Cortex needs.

COORDINATOR MASTER - MoE ROUTING REPORT
================================================================================

Task Routing Complete: task-1762961220
Timestamp: 2025-11-12T15:47:37Z

TASK DETAILS
------------
Title: CRITICAL: Investigate Worker Launcher Script Bug - Task Context Injection Failure
Priority: CRITICAL
Type: Investigation

INCIDENT SUMMARY
----------------
- 6 governance workers failed immediately upon launch (70+ minutes ago)
- Root cause: Worker launcher script not properly injecting task context
- Symptoms: Empty task IDs, unsubstituted placeholder text (TASK_CONTEXT_PLACEHOLDER)
- Worker specs incorrectly showing "running" status

Affected Workers:
  - dev-worker-04B8F99C
  - dev-worker-72AB3732
  - dev-worker-899AB82C
  - dev-worker-21C2A367
  - sec-worker-DC77FC1A
  - sec-worker-48C1327F

Script Under Investigation:
  /Users/ryandahlberg/cortex/scripts/claude-worker-launcher-v2.sh

MOE ROUTING ANALYSIS
--------------------
Pattern Matching Results:
  ✓ Development Pattern: bug.*fix|code|script debugging
    Confidence: 0.95 (STRONG MATCH)
    
  ~ Security Pattern: governance (related)
    Confidence: 0.40 (WEAK MATCH)
    
  ✗ Inventory Pattern: No match
    Confidence: 0.10

Routing Decision: DEVELOPMENT MASTER
Confidence Score: 0.95
Rule Used: code-development

Reasoning:
- Script debugging requires development expertise
- Bug investigation and fixing is core development work
- Strong pattern match on "bug.*fix" and "script"
- Development master has necessary capabilities for script analysis

ROUTING ACTIONS TAKEN
----------------------
✓ Created handoff file:

✓ Added task to queue:
  - Status: assigned
  - Assigned to: development-master
  - Total tasks in queue: 99

✓ Logged dashboard event:
  - Event type: task_routed
  - MoE confidence: 0.95

✓ Marked incoming handoff as processed:
  - to-coordinator-task-1762961220.json.processed

GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS
------------------------
- Findings must be added to MoE learning system for pattern prevention
- User directive: "MoE should investigate the launcher script and all scripts moving forward"
- This establishes autonomous quality checking for system scripts

EXPECTED OUTCOMES
-----------------
1. Root cause analysis of launcher script bug
2. Bug fix implementation and testing
3. Documentation of findings for MoE knowledge base
4. Pattern prevention measures added to learning system
5. Governance framework for autonomous script validation

WORKLOAD NOTE
-------------
Development master currently busy with 15 tasks, but CRITICAL priority
overrides normal workload considerations.

HANDOFF STATUS

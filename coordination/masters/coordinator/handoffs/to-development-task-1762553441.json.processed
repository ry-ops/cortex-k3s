Actual issue: task-queue.json contains 61 tasks in tasks[] array but metadata shows total_tasks:5, pending_tasks:3, in_progress_tasks:0, completed_tasks:2. This causes dashboard to display incorrect task counts and queue appears empty. Root causes to investigate: 1) Metadata not updated when tasks are added via create-task.sh, 2) Task status changes not triggering metadata recalculation, 3) DDQD stress test tasks (moe-test-ddqd-v5-*) not being counted, 4) Possible race condition in concurrent task updates. Fix requirements: Create task-queue metadata sync utility that recalculates accurate counts from tasks array, add metadata validation on every task queue update, fix create-task.sh to update metadata correctly, add periodic metadata sync job to coordinator daemon, handle edge cases (test tasks, zombie workers, stale assignments). Also investigate why many tasks show status=assigned but no worker progress - may indicate worker spawn failures. Test with current 61-task queue state before cleanup.

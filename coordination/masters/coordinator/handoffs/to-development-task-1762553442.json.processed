Investigate: 1) WebSocket connection between dashboard frontend and server - check WS handshake, connection status, message streaming, 2) Dashboard server event streaming logic in dashboard/server/index.js - verify event reading from JSONL, WebSocket broadcast functionality, file watching with chokidar, 3) Frontend event display in dashboard/public/index.html - check Alpine.js event handling, event rendering, filtering logic, 4) Event parsing errors - check browser console for JSON parse errors (events may be malformed), 5) CORS/authentication issues blocking WebSocket after security updates, 6) File permissions on dashboard-events.jsonl preventing reads. Test with latest event timestamp 2025-11-08T16:03:45-0600. Verify events are being broadcast via WebSocket, frontend is receiving them, and Alpine.js is rendering them.

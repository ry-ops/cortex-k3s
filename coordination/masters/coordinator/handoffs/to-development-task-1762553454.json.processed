    "type": "development",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "assigned",
    "description": "Add validation layer to automatically fix malformed JSON before writing. Current issue: Frequent JSON parsing errors causing dashboard disruptions. Solution: Implement pre-write validation that detects and repairs common JSON errors (missing commas, trailing commas, unclosed brackets). Add validation to emit-event.sh and dashboard server. Include error recovery and logging. Technical: Use jq for validation, add JSON repair utilities, implement validation hooks in event emission pipeline. Benefits: Prevents dashboard crashes, eliminates data corruption, improves reliability.",

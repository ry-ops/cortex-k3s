Current state: Worker pool shows 20/8 active workers (250% capacity), all are zombies from DDQD stress tests created Nov 8 15:24 (4+ hours ago). Worker daemon refusing to spawn ANY new workers, blocking 4 critical security tasks (task-1762553439, task-1762553440, task-1762553441, task-1762553442). Root causes: 1) Zombie-killer daemon (PID 76168) running but NOT detecting/cleaning stale workers, 2) Workers stuck in 'pending' status with null heartbeats for hours, 3) 15-minute stale timeout not being enforced, 4) Heartbeat monitoring broken or not implemented. REQUIRED FIXES: 1) IMMEDIATELY move all 20 stale workers from coordination/worker-specs/active/ to coordination/worker-specs/failed/ to unblock pool (CRITICAL - do this first\\!), 2) Debug and fix zombie-killer-daemon.sh stale worker detection logic (check heartbeat comparison, timeout calculation, PID validation), 3) Add aggressive stale worker detection (any worker pending >30 min with null heartbeat = zombie), 4) Implement worker heartbeat monitoring if missing, 5) Add pool capacity safeguards (auto-cleanup when >150% capacity), 6) Test zombie-killer runs and validates cleanup works, 7) Document what went wrong and prevention measures. SUCCESS CRITERIA: Pool capacity drops to 0-2 active workers, 4 pending critical tasks get assigned and spawn workers within 2 minutes, zombie-killer properly detects and cleans future stale workers. URGENT: System is completely non-functional until this is fixed.

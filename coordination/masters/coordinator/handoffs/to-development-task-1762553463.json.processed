    "title": "PROMPT ENGINEERING UPGRADE - Phase 6: Production Hardening. Ensure upgraded system is production-ready with monitoring, alerting, and failsafes. OBJECTIVES: 1) Integrate circuit breakers (from task-1762553455) into all agent call paths - coordinator routing, worker spawning, API calls. 2) Implement rate limiting to prevent LLM API overload - 30 calls per 60s window, exponential backoff on limit hit. 3) Create monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics: agent call volume, validation success rates, retry rates, schema violations, circuit breaker states, rate limit usage. 4) Build alerting system that triggers on: validation failure >10%, retry rate >20%, circuit breaker opens, schema violations detected, rate limit exceeded. 5) Create operations runbook documenting: common failure modes, remediation steps, rollback procedures, emergency contacts. 6) Add health check endpoints and implement automated recovery. TECHNICAL: Use existing circuit-breaker.js, add Prometheus-compatible /metrics endpoint, integrate with dashboard server. DELIVERABLES: Circuit breaker integration, rate limiter, monitoring dashboard, alerting system, ops runbook. SUCCESS: 99.9% uptime, <5min MTTR, zero data loss.",

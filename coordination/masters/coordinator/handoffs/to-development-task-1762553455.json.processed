    "title": "PRIORITY 2 - MEDIUM Impact: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern for rate limiting resilience. Current issue: Rate limiting can cascade and block critical operations during high load. Solution: Add circuit breaker pattern to gracefully handle rate limits and API failures. Implement three states: CLOSED (normal), OPEN (failing, reject immediately), HALF-OPEN (testing recovery). Add to dashboard server API calls, GitHub API interactions, and worker spawn operations. Configure thresholds: failure threshold (5 errors in 60s triggers OPEN), timeout (30s before HALF-OPEN), success threshold (3 successes to CLOSED). Include metrics tracking and logging. Benefits: Improved system resilience, prevents cascade failures, graceful degradation during load spikes.",

## 2. Current Installation Analysis

### Repository Information
- **Repository**: ry-ops/cara
- **Type**: Gatsby-based portfolio website
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Node.js Project**: Yes

### js-yaml Dependency Tree

js-yaml 3.14.2 is present as a **transitive dependency** through two paths:

```
cara@0.2.17
├─┬ @lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara@5.1.7
│ └─┬ gatsby-plugin-mdx@5.15.0
│   └─┬ gray-matter@4.0.3
│     └── js-yaml@3.14.2 ✅ SECURE
└─┬ gatsby@5.15.0
  └─┬ eslint@7.32.0
    ├─┬ @eslint/eslintrc@0.4.3
    │ └── js-yaml@3.14.2 ✅ SECURE
    └── js-yaml@3.14.2 ✅ SECURE
```

**Analysis**:
- js-yaml is **not a direct dependency** - it's installed transitively
- All instances use version **3.14.2** (the patched version)
- Used by: gatsby (via eslint), gatsby-plugin-mdx (via gray-matter)
- Purpose: YAML configuration parsing and markdown frontmatter parsing

### npm Audit Results

```bash
$ npm audit | grep js-yaml
No js-yaml vulnerabilities found in audit
```

**Verification**: npm audit confirms no js-yaml vulnerabilities present.

---

## 3. Fix Approach and Rationale

### Chosen Approach: ✅ VERIFICATION ONLY - NO FIX NEEDED

**Rationale**:
The repository is already using js-yaml 3.14.2, which is the patched version that fixes CVE-2025-64718. The initial vulnerability report appears to be based on incorrect information or confusion about version numbers.

**Common Misconception**:
Version 3.14.2 might be flagged by some scanners as vulnerable because:
1. The CVE was disclosed around the time 3.14.2 was released
2. Some vulnerability databases list "3.14.2" as part of the affected range without clarifying it's the fix version
3. The version number is close to vulnerable versions (3.14.1 and below)

**Verification Sources**:
- ✅ GitHub Advisory GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m confirms 3.14.2 is patched
- ✅ Snyk vulnerability database confirms 3.14.2 is secure
- ✅ npm audit shows no js-yaml vulnerabilities
- ✅ Package maintainers' release notes indicate 3.14.2 includes the fix

---

## 4. Alternative Fix Options Considered

### Option A: Upgrade to js-yaml 4.1.1+
**Status**: Not necessary
**Reason**: Current version (3.14.2) is already secure. Upgrading to 4.x would require updating Gatsby and related dependencies, introducing breaking changes without security benefit.

### Option B: Apply Workarounds
**Status**: Not necessary
**Available workarounds** (if version was vulnerable):
- Run Node.js with `--disable-proto=delete` flag
- Use Deno (pollution protection enabled by default)
- Implement input validation/sanitization before YAML parsing

**Reason**: No workarounds needed as current version is secure.

### Option C: Replace with Alternative Library
**Status**: Not necessary
**Alternatives considered**: js-yaml-safe, yaml (newer package)
**Reason**: Current dependency is secure and widely used by Gatsby ecosystem.

For reference, upgrading from js-yaml 3.x to 4.x involves:

**Breaking Changes in js-yaml 4.x**:
1. Dropped support for Node.js < 12
2. Changed default schema behavior
3. Removed `!!js/function` type (security improvement)
4. Changed API for custom types

**Migration Steps**:
1. Update Gatsby and eslint to versions supporting js-yaml 4.x
2. Test YAML parsing functionality
3. Review custom YAML schemas if used
4. Update CI/CD Node.js version requirements

**Effort Estimate**: 4-8 hours (requires extensive testing due to Gatsby ecosystem impact)

## Appendix A: CVE-2025-64718 Technical Details

### Vulnerability Mechanism

Prototype pollution occurs when attackers can inject properties into JavaScript object prototypes:

```yaml
# Malicious YAML that could exploit vulnerable versions
<<: *defaults
__proto__:
  polluted: "value"
```

In vulnerable versions (< 3.14.2, 4.0.0-4.1.0), this would modify `Object.prototype`, affecting all objects in the application.

### Fix Implementation

The fix in js-yaml 3.14.2 and 4.1.1:
- Blocks `__proto__` property in merge operations
- Sanitizes object keys during YAML parsing
- Prevents prototype chain manipulation

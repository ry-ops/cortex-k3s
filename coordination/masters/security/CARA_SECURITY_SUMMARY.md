## Detailed Findings

### 1. Vulnerability Analysis

**CVE-2025-64718** is a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in js-yaml's merge operation:
- Affects versions **< 3.14.2** and **4.0.0 - 4.1.0**
- Fixed in versions **3.14.2** and **4.1.1**
- Allows attackers to modify object prototypes via `__proto__` in YAML documents

### 2. Current Installation

js-yaml 3.14.2 is present as a **transitive dependency**:

```
cara@0.2.17
├── gatsby@5.15.0
│   └── eslint@7.32.0
│       └── js-yaml@3.14.2 ✅
└── @lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara@5.1.7
    └── gatsby-plugin-mdx@5.15.0
        └── gray-matter@4.0.3
            └── js-yaml@3.14.2 ✅
```

**npm audit result**: No js-yaml vulnerabilities detected ✅

### 3. Why This Was Flagged

This false positive likely occurred because:

### 4. Verification

Multiple sources confirm 3.14.2 is secure:
- ✅ GitHub Advisory GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m
- ✅ Snyk vulnerability database
- ✅ npm audit (no vulnerabilities)
- ✅ js-yaml maintainer release notes

    "title": "PROMPT ENGINEERING UPGRADE - Phase 2: Validation & Control Loops. Build validation layers and retry mechanisms for every agent output. OBJECTIVES: 1) Integrate Phase 1 schemas into all agent workflows - add validation wrappers to emit-event.sh, spawn-worker.sh, create-task.sh, moe-router.sh. 2) Implement control loops for critical paths: coordinator routing with validation+retry, handoff creation with validation, task assignment validation. 3) Add retry logic to all agent calls with exponential backoff - max 3 retries with tighter instructions each time. 4) Build validation middleware for all JSON file operations. TECHNICAL: Update all bash scripts to use lib/safe-json.js wrappers, add validation hooks to coordination file writers, implement circuit breaker integration from task-1762553455. DELIVERABLES: All coordination writes use safeWriteJSON, control loops for routing/handoffs/assignments, retry logic library, validation middleware integrated. SUCCESS: 99%+ first-pass validation rate, <1 schema violation per day, <5% retry rate.",

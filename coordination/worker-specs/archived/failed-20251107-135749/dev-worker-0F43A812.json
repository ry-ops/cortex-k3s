Workers complete in 30 seconds because they're not running Claude at all. FIX REQUIRED: 1) Replace autonomous-worker.sh fallback behavior to launch actual Claude Code session with worker prompt, 2) Pass task context to Claude properly, 3) Add worker health monitoring daemon that checks if Claude process is actually running, 4) Implement zombie killer to detect workers marked 'running' with no active process (>15 min stale) and mark them failed, 5) Add worker execution logs showing Claude Code startup and actual implementation work. The system should NEVER create test output files unless explicitly requested - it must run real Claude Code sessions.",

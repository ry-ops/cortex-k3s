    "description": "PRIORITY 4: Fix PM Daemon - Investigate and resolve PM daemon stability issues. Current issue: PM daemon not staying running consistently, affecting project management automation. Investigation areas: 1) Check for missing dependencies or libraries required by pm-daemon.sh, 2) Review daemon startup scripts and initialization sequence, 3) Analyze crash logs and error messages in agents/logs/system/, 4) Check for configuration issues in coordination/pm-state.json, 5) Verify process monitoring and restart mechanisms, 6) Test daemon under various load conditions. Root cause analysis: Determine if issue is environment-related, code bug, resource exhaustion, or race condition. Implement fixes: Add proper error handling, improve logging, add health checks, implement auto-restart on failure. Validate: Ensure daemon stays running for 24+ hours under normal load.",

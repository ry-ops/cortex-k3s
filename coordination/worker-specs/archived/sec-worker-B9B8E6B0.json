    "title": "PROMPT ENGINEERING UPGRADE - Phase 3: Observability & Tracing. Implement comprehensive tracing so every prompt→output chain is visible and measurable. OBJECTIVES: 1) Build tracing infrastructure with PromptTracer class - startTrace, recordStep, endTrace methods storing in coordination/traces/. 2) Instrument all agent calls with tracing: coordinator routing, development implementation, security scanning, inventory cataloging. 3) Create trace explorer dashboard at dashboard/public/traces.html - view all traces, filter by operation/agent/status, inspect full prompt→output chains. 4) Add metrics collection: first-pass validation rate by agent, retry rate by operation, tokens per operation, latency p50/p95/p99, schema violation types. 5) Build trace analysis tools in scripts/analyze-traces.sh. TECHNICAL: Store traces as JSONL in coordination/traces/, integrate with dashboard WebSocket for real-time updates, use dashboard event system. DELIVERABLES: lib/tracing/tracer.js, trace storage, trace explorer UI, metrics dashboard, analysis scripts. SUCCESS: 100% agent calls traced, traces retained 30 days, metrics updated every 5min.",

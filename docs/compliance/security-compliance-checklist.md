## Overview

Comprehensive security compliance checklist for cortex Achievement Master and MoE system.

**Compliance Standards**: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, ISO 27001

---

## Authentication & Access Control

### ✅ Token Management

- [ ] GitHub Personal Access Token configured
- [ ] Token has minimum required scopes (repo, workflow, read:org)
- [ ] Token stored in environment variables (not committed)
- [ ] Token rotation policy configured (90-day threshold)
- [ ] Token rotation log maintained (`coordination/governance/token-rotation-log.jsonl`)
- [ ] Elastic APM API key secured
- [ ] API keys use environment variables only

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check token configuration
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | grep -q "ghp_" && echo "✅ Token configured" || echo "❌ Token missing"

# Verify token age
./scripts/security/token-rotation.sh check
```

### ✅ Access Control

- [ ] Governance module enabled (`lib/governance/access-control.js`)
- [ ] Access log maintained (`coordination/governance/access-log.jsonl`)
- [ ] Worker spawn permissions enforced
- [ ] API endpoints protected with rate limiting
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) configured

**Verification**:
```bash
# Test access control
node lib/governance/access-control.js check \
  --actor "achievement-master" \
  --action "spawn_worker" \
  --resource "scan-worker"
```

---

## Data Protection

### ✅ Sensitive Data Handling

- [ ] No credentials in git history
- [ ] `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Secrets masked in logs
- [ ] API responses sanitized (no token leakage)
- [ ] Worker logs exclude sensitive data

**Verification**:
```bash
# Scan for leaked secrets
git secrets --scan

# Check git history for tokens
git log -p | grep -E "ghp_|AKIA|sk-"
```

### ✅ Encryption

- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all API calls
- [ ] GitHub API uses TLS 1.2+
- [ ] Elastic APM connection encrypted
- [ ] Webhook payloads use HTTPS
- [ ] Database connections encrypted (if applicable)

**Verification**:
```bash
# Verify TLS version
openssl s_client -connect api.github.com:443 -tls1_2
```

---

## Network Security

### ✅ API Rate Limiting

- [ ] GitHub API rate limiter configured (4500/hour)
- [ ] Achievement API rate limiter (100/15min)
- [ ] Worker spawn rate limiter (20/hour)
- [ ] Adaptive rate limiting with backoff
- [ ] Rate limit violations logged

**Verification**:
```bash
# Test rate limiting
curl -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:5001/api/achievements/progress
```

### ✅ Firewall & Network Policies

- [ ] Outbound HTTPS allowed to github.com
- [ ] Outbound HTTPS allowed to cloud.elastic.co
- [ ] Inbound limited to necessary ports only
- [ ] DDoS protection enabled (if using cloud provider)
- [ ] IP whitelisting configured (optional)

---

## Monitoring & Logging

### ✅ Security Event Logging

- [ ] All authentication attempts logged
- [ ] Access control decisions logged
- [ ] Worker spawn events logged
- [ ] API calls logged with metadata
- [ ] Failed requests logged with context

**Log Locations**:
```bash
coordination/governance/access-log.jsonl
coordination/metrics/security-scan-history.jsonl
coordination/governance/token-rotation-log.jsonl
```

### ✅ Alerting

- [ ] Critical security events trigger alerts
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts monitored
- [ ] Unusual API usage patterns detected
- [ ] Token expiration warnings configured
- [ ] Vulnerability scan alerts enabled

**Alert Channels**:
- Slack: `#security-alerts`
- Email: `security@cortex.io`
- PagerDuty: Critical escalation

---

## Vulnerability Management

### ✅ Dependency Scanning

- [ ] npm audit runs on every PR
- [ ] Snyk integration enabled
- [ ] Dependency updates automated
- [ ] CVE monitoring active
- [ ] Security scan results reviewed weekly

**Verification**:
```bash
# Run security scan
npm audit

# Check for high/critical vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

### ✅ Code Security

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- [ ] Input validation on all API endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS protection enabled
- [ ] CSRF tokens used for state-changing operations

**Verification**:
```bash
# Scan for common vulnerabilities
./agents/workers/security-scan-worker.sh \
  --task-id security-audit-$(date +%s) \
  --scan-types static-analysis,secrets
```

## Incident Response

### ✅ Incident Response Plan

- [ ] Security incident runbook documented
- [ ] Contact list maintained
- [ ] Escalation procedures defined
